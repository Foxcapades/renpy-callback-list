<p>
  Create lists of character callbacks with ease!
</p>
<p>
  Have you ever needed to create multiple callbacks on the same character that
  do different things?  Do you not want to cram unrelated things into a single
  callback?  If so, this is the tool for you!
</p>
<p>
  This library provides a tiny helper class called <code>CallbackList</code>
  that groups multiple character callbacks into a single callable!
</p>
<p>
  It's just a class that wraps callbacks, it's that simple!
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre>
init python:
    def cb1(event, interact=True, **kwargs):
        ...

    def cb2(event, interact=True, **kwargs):
        ...

define e = Character("Eileen", callback=CallbackList(cb1, cb2))
</pre>
<ol>
  <li>Create your character callbacks</li>
  <li>Define your character(s)</li>
  <li>Create a <code>CallbackList</code></li>
  <li>Pass that <code>CallbackList</code> to the target character(s) with the <code>callback</code> keyword.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>Inline CallbackLists</h4>
<p>
  If you only have one character that you want to apply the
  <code>CallbackList</code> to, you can inline the construction of that
  <code>CallbackList</code> in the character constructor:
</p>
<pre>
define e = Character("Eileen", callback=CallbackList(cb1, cb2))
</pre>

<h4>Separate CallbackLists</h4>
<p>
  If you want to use the same CallbackList for multiple characters, you may
  define it separately and pass it to the character constructors:
</p>
<pre>
define my_cb_list = CallbackList(cb1, cb2)

define a = Character("Annie", callback=my_cb_list)
define e = Character("Eileen", callback=my_cb_list)
</pre>
